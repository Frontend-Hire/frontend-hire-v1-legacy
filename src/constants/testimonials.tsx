          We have worked together and I found Hruthik{' '}
          <strong>highly dedicated and skilled professional.</strong> He is
          always keen to explore new things and used to introduce the latest
          tech to the team(with so many pros in it than the ones we were already
          using in our projects). He&apos;s a great teammate to work with.{' '}
          <strong>I highly recommend him.</strong>

          Hruthik is a very passionate and knowledgeable person.{' '}
          <strong>I enjoyed working with him.</strong> He has very deep
          knowledge of programming and design. Hruthik has a helping nature and{' '}
          <strong>I learnt a lot from him </strong>
          during our short tenure of working together, about React, Typescript,
          Redux, Scss and most importantly how to write better, efficient, and
          scalable code.

          Hruthik is able to excel in any technical skill due to his passion and
          quick learning nature.{' '}

            Hruthik is truly an amazing guy and he is so damn helpful.
          </strong>{' '}
          He literally taught me how to set up a proper project. He would give
          the task and also guide me through it teaching the conventions and
          also making me apply it.

          The interview was supposed to be 45 min but he took it to 1 hr 40 min

          comfortable. <strong>It was an incredible experience for me.</strong>
