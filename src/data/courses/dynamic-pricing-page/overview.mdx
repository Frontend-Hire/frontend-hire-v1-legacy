# Dynamic Pricing Page

<Callout>
We recommend reading the ["Design A Dynamic Pricing Page"](/system-design/dynamic-pricing-page/overview) system design first.
</Callout>

In this course, you will learn how to build a dynamic pricing page. We will cover the following topics:

- Rendering Strategies with Next.js Pages Router
- Rendering Strategies with Next.js App Router

Though we are building a pricing page, the concept of rendering strategies is more important to understand here and the skills are transferrable to many other projects.

Stuff you will work with this course:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) 
- Server Actions
