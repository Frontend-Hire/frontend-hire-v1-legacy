# E2E Testing Login Flow

As you can see, how much logic is involved in the login flow (similarly in flows like register, payments, etc.,). We have to check if the user is already logged in, if not then we have to click on the login button, then we have to enter the email and password, and then click on the login button. These are a lot of steps to test manually. Also, imagine bigger flows of the application, it will be tiring to test them manually with every change in the code.

This is where E2E testing comes into play.
