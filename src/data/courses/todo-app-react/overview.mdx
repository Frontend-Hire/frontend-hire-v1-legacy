# Todo App with React, TypeScript, and TDD

<Callout>
There is also a [Svelte version](/courses/todo-app-svelte/overview) of this course for Pro users.
</Callout>

Todo apps are a great way to learn a new language or framework. We teach this course with more than React.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:

- Good Project Setup for React (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- Component Composition
- Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library

The GitHub repo for this course is [here](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/todo-app-react-tdd-typescript).
