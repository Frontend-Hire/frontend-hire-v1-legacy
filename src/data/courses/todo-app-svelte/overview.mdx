# Todo App with Svelte, TypeScript, and TDD

<Callout>
We initially built this course in [React](/courses/todo-app-react/overview). We then repurposed that course to create this Svelte version.
</Callout>

Todo apps are a great way to learn a new language or framework. We teach this course with more than Svelte.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:

- Good Project Setup for Svelte (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- Component Composition
- Testing with Vitest and Svelte Testing Library

The GitHub repo for this course is [here](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/todo-app-svelte-tdd-typescript).
