# Can you center a div?

> This is a classic joke in the CSS community.

"Centering a div" â€“ this phrase might sound simple, but it's a longstanding joke in the CSS community due to the surprising complexity it can involve. Your task is to center the div both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

```
<div>Center Me</div>
```

### Instructions

- Write your CSS in the **styles.css** file to center the div element horizontally and vertically on the page.
- Your solution should use classic CSS. However, if you prefer, you can opt for TailwindCSS.

#### Enabling TailwindCSS (Optional)

If you choose to use TailwindCSS, include this script in the head of your **index.html** file:

```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

#### Notes

- Consider the different ways to achieve centering in CSS, and feel free to showcase a method that best represents your understanding of CSS.
