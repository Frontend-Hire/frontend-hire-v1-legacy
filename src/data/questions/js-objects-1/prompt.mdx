# Objects - 1

> Why did the JavaScript developer leave their job?
> Because they didn't like being treated as mere objects!

## Objectives

- Examine the provided code in `/index.js` and `/index.test.js`. Understand how `user` and `tempUser` are related.
- Notice how `tempUser` is modified and predict how these changes affect `user`.
- Understand why the tests are designed in a certain way and what they aim to check.

## Tests

- This question does not expect you to write tests. The tests are already provided and are read-only!
- Do read the tests and passing tests will indicate that you have solved the problem.
