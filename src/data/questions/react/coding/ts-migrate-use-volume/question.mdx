# TypeScript: Migrate useVolume

Remember our question ["Hooks: useVolume"](/questions/react/coding/use-volume) but that was in JavaScript. Try to migrate it to TypeScript.

> TypeScript interfaces are like the bouncer at a club - they let the right types in, and keep the wrong ones out.

## Objectives

- Migrate all the `.js, .jsx` files to `.ts, .tsx` files.
- Make sure there is no use of `any` type in the code.
