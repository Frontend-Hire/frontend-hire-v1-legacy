# TypeScript: Migrate useVolume

Remember our question ["Hooks: useVolume"](/questions/react/coding/use-volume) but that was in JavaScript. Try to migrate it to TypeScript.

> TypeScript interfaces are like the bouncer at a club - they let the right types in, and keep the wrong ones out.

## Objectives

- This question depends on the ["Hooks: useVolume"](/questions/react/coding/use-volume) for the initial JS-based solution. You can copy the code from there or solve it again.
- The custom `useVolume` hook should be generic enough to support any media element such as audio or video player that has a `volume` property.
- Make sure there is no use of `any` type in the code.
