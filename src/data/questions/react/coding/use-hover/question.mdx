# Testing: use Hover

You will be building a custom hook that will track the mouse hover state of an element, if no element is provided to hook, it should point to the document object.

> React developers do TDD because they prefer their components shaken, not stirred.

## Objectives

- Implement the `useHover` custom hook in the `useHover.ts` file.
- The hook should return a boolean value that indicates whether the mouse is hovering over the provided element.
- If no element is provided, the hook should use the document object as the default element.
- Write tests for the `useHover` hook in the `useHover.test.ts` file.
