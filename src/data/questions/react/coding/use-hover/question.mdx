# useHover

Create a custom hook that tracks the hover state of an element. The hook should return a boolean value indicating whether the element is being hovered over. If no element is provided, the hook should track the hover state of the entire document.

## Objectives

1. Implement a useHover custom hook that:
    - Returns an object with isHovering (boolean) and refElement (React ref)
    - Tracks hover state for a specific element or the entire document

2. Ensure the hook:
    - Adds and removes event listeners appropriately
    - Handles both element-specific and document-wide hover tracking
    - Cleans up event listeners on component unmount

3. Use the useHover hook in the provided App component to display the hover state of the document or a specific element.
