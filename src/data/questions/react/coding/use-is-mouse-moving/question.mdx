# useIsMouseMoving

You will be implementing a custom hook called `useIsMouseMoving` that will return a boolean `isMouseMoving` value indicating if the mouse is moving or not inside a particular element & a ref `refElement`  that can be attached to a specific element to track mouse movement within it. By default the hook will track mouse movement for the entire document. The hook should also accept an optional configuration object with a `delay` property (default: 300ms) to control the throttle interval.

## Objectives
1. Implement a custom React hook called useIsMouseMoving.
2. The hook should return an object with two properties:
    - `isMouseMoving`: a boolean indicating whether the mouse is currently moving.
    - `refElement`: a ref object that can be attached to a specific element to track mouse movement within it.
3. Accept an optional configuration object with a `delay` property (default: 300ms) to control the **throttle interval**.
4. Apply throttling to the mouse movement detection.
5. If no specific element is provided (via refElement), track mouse movement for the **entire document**.
