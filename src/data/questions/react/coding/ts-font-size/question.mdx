# TypeScript: Font Size

With this question, you will learn a weird thing about TypeScript that helps with better autocomplete.

## Objectives

- Your task is to create a good API for the `Text` component.
- It should only take one prop: `fontSize` which is optional and takes either `sm`, `lg`, or any valid string value like `"1.5rem"`.
- Basically this prop should have:
  - A default `fontSize` of `1rem`.
  - A small `fontSize` of `0.75rem` but the value passed to the API should be `sm`.
  - A large `fontSize` of `1.25rem` but the value passed to the API should be `lg`.
  - Can also take any string value as `fontSize` like `"1.5rem"`.
- Of course, we need type safety along with good auto-completion.
