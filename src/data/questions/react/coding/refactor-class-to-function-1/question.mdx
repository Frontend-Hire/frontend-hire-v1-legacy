# Refactor: Class to Function Components - 1

> "The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity." - Marijn Haverbeke

Though modern React applications are built using function components, there are still many class components in the wild. You might need to refactor a class component to a function component for various reasons. This question gives you such a refactoring opportunity.

## Objectives
- Refactor the `App`, `TodoList`, and `AddTodo` class components to function components using React Hooks.
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the state within the function components.
- Ensure the application functionality remains unchanged after the refactor.
