# TypeScript: Migrate useState - 1

Remember our question ["useState - 1"](/questions/react/coding/use-state-1) but that was in JavaScript. Try to migrate it to TypeScript.

> Why did the TypeScript developer quit their job working on a React project?
> They couldn't handle all the 'prop'-erty damage!

## Objectives

- Migrate all the `.js, .jsx` files to `.ts, .tsx` files.
- Make sure there is no use of `any` type in the code.
