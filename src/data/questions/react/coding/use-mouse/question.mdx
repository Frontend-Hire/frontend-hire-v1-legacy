# useMouse

You will be implementing a custom hook called `useMouse` that will return position of mouse, it will also return a ref, using which you can attach it to any element and get the position of mouse relative to that element.

> React developers do TDD because they prefer their components shaken, not stirred.
## Objectives

- Implement a custom hook `useMouse` that returns the position of the mouse.
- This hook should return three values:
    - `mousePosition` - an object with `x` and `y` keys representing the absolute position of the mouse.
    - `refMousePosition` - an object with `x` and `y` keys representing the position of the mouse relative to the element.
    - `ref` - a ref that can be attached to any element to get the position of the mouse relative to that element.
- Implement a component `MouseTracker` that uses the `useMouse` hook to display the position of the mouse.
