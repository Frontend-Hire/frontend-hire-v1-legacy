# Hooks: useVolume

A generic volume control hook. Can you use it to create a volume control for your music or video player?

> Why did the React developer turn down the volume? Because the hooks kept ref-erencing too much noise!

## Objective

Implement the custom `useVolume` hook to control the volume of an audio player or a video player.

## Requirements

- The custom hook should take a default value for the initial volume.
- The custom hook should return a reference to the audio or video element, along with the current volume and a function to update the volume.

**Note:**
- A helper component `CustomAudioControl` is given for you to interface with the custom hook.
- Sample audio and video files are provided.
- The default controls on the `audio` and `video` are enabled for testing purposes.
