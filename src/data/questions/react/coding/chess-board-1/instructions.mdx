# Local Instructions (Optional)

  While this question can be solved in the browser, you may find it challenging to work with React without IDE support. Although this can be frustrating, it does offer an opportunity to practice typing and improve your understanding of core concepts.

  In an interview setting, the availability of an IDE may vary. We recommend asking the interviewer if you're allowed to use one. However, being comfortable coding without extensive IDE support is a valuable skill.

  If you prefer a local environment with your favorite IDE, you can follow the instructions below.
