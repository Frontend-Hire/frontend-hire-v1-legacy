<Callout type='warning'>
If you feel like something is not working as expected with TypeScript, just try to restart the TypeScript server. 

**This is how you do it in VSCode:**

- Open the Command Palette:
  - For **Mac**: Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
  - For **Windows**: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

- Type "**TypeScript: Restart TS Server**"
- Select the command from the list

This will restart the TypeScript server, which can often resolve unexpected behavior or issues with TypeScript in VSCode. 

Sometimes a restart to the dev server might also be needed.
