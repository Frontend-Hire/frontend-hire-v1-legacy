# Testing: Todo App - 1

You built a Todo App and sent it to the testing team. They sent you a list of bugs. How do you proceed to fix them?

> React developers do TDD because they prefer their components shaken, not stirred.

## Testing Team Bugs List

- After adding a task, the input field should be cleared.
- You should not be able to add empty tasks.
- You should be able to add tasks by pressing enter while the focus is on the input field.

## Objectives

- Reproduce and fix the bugs.
- Approach with either a TDD (test-driven development) or a regular testing approach.
