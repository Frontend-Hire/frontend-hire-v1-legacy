# Refactor: Long Method 1

> Why do programmers dislike going to the gym?
> Because they lose their breath just scrolling through long methods!

## Objectives
- Identify the code in the 'processSalesData' function that can be refactored.
- Write tests to confirm the current behavior of the function.
- Apply the 'Extract Method' technique to break down the function into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Ensure that the refactored code passes all the provided tests.

## Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:
- The function correctly calculates the total sales for valid sales records.
- The function ignores sales records with negative amounts.
- The function handles an empty array without errors.
