# Vanilla JS: Like Button Component

> I created a like button for my website, but it seems people prefer to dislike my content.

## Requirements

- Create a button with the text "Like" and a heart icon to the left of the text
- Initial (unclicked) state:
  - Gray text (#808080)
  - Gray heart icon (#808080)
  - Gray border (#808080)
  - Text should be "Like"
- Hover state:
  - Red text (#FF0000)
  - Red heart icon (#FF0000)
  - Red border (#FF0000)
- Liked (clicked) state:
  - White text (#FFFFFF)
  - White heart icon (#FFFFFF)
  - Red background color (#FF0000)
  - Text should be "Liked"
- Implement interaction with a back-end service:
  - When the user clicks the button, call a back-end service (simulate a network request with a timeout) 
  - While the request is processing, display a loading or processing state
  - Loading text should be "Liking..." with the same styles as "Hover state" but all actions should be disabled
  - Only update the button to the "clicked" state once the request is complete
  - Liked state should have a text of "Liked"
- The button should return to its initial state if clicked again
- Implement error handling for failed requests
- Ensure the button state persists across page reloads
