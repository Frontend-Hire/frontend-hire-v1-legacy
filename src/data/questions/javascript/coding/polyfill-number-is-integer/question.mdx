# Polyfill: Number.isInteger() Static Method

> Why did Number.isInteger and polyfills start a band? Because they wanted to make sure they stayed in tune with all the latest hits! 

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the Number.isInteger() static method.

## Objectives

- Understand how the Number.isInteger() static method works in JavaScript.
- Implement a polyfill for the Number.isInteger() static method called `Number.myIsInteger`.
- Write tests to verify your implementation behaves as expected.

## Tests

Consider writing tests based on your understanding of the Number.isInteger() static method. You can also do a TDD approach to this problem if you prefer.
