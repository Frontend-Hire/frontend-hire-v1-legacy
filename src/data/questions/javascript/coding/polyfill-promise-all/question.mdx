# Polyfill: Promise.all() Static Method

> Why did Promise.all and polyfills go on a date? Because they wanted to make sure all their issues were resolved together!

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. Also, they are interview questions that are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews. In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the Promise.all() static method. 

## Objectives

- Understand how the Promise.all() static method works in JavaScript.
- Implement a polyfill for the Promise.all() static method called Promise.myAll.
- Write tests to verify your implementation behaves as expected.

## Tests

Consider writing tests based on your understanding of the Promise.all() static method. You can also do a TDD approach to this problem if you prefer.
