# Flatten an Object

With at least a year of experience under your belt, you're expected not just to write functional code but also to ensure its reliability through comprehensive testing. Your task here is to write a function that flattens a given object, and equally important, to write test cases that thoroughly check the functionality of your code.

> Use case? Pretty common to have an object with nested structure and you want to flatten it! Sample inputs might give you better idea of the use case. 

#### What to do?
Given an object, print out the keys and values in-order. 

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
- An empty object should return an empty string.
- Consider other potential edge cases and include them in your tests.

```
Input - 1: 
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": "49"
}
```
```
Output - 1:
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
age: 49
```
```
Input - 2: 
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John"
    "lastName": "Doe",
  }
  "age": "49"
}
```
```
Output - 2:
id: 123
name:
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
age: 49
```
