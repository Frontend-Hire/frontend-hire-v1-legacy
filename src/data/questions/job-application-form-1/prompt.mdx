# Job Application Form - 1

Building forms is not easy.

Creating web forms is a fundamental skill for web developers. This challenge asks you to construct a simple yet functional job application form based on provided specifications and a design mockup. Remember, this is an HTML-focused task, so don't worry about styling with CSS just yet. Pay special attention to making the form accessible.

#### Requirement
Your form should include the following elements:

1. **Full Name:** A field to enter the user's full name, with a placeholder for guidance.
2. **Email Address:** A field for the user's email, with browser-based validation and a placeholder.
3. **Gender Selection:** Radio buttons for the user to select their gender - options include Male, Female, and Not Listed.
4. **Application Reason:** A text area for the user to explain why they want to join your organization. This should allow for longer input.
5. **Primary Skill:** A dropdown (select input) to choose a primary skill. Populate this with a random list of skills.
6. **Terms and Conditions:** A checkbox for the user to agree or disagree with the terms and conditions.
7. **Submit Button:** A button to submit the form.

#### Design Reference

Refer to the following design mockup for the layout and structure of the form:

#### Notes

- While the focus is on HTML, ensure the form is accessible, which is a crucial aspect of web development.
- The design mockup serves as a guide for the form layout. Aim to closely match the form fields and structure as shown in the design.
