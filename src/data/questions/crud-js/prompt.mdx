# CRUD

> Why did the software developer go broke? 
> Because he only knew how to CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete - but forgot the most important one: SELL!

### Objectives

Your task is to create a simple task management system where tasks can be added, viewed, modified, and deleted. This will involve:

- Creating a new task: Adding a new task to the list.
- Reading tasks: Retrieving either all tasks or specific tasks based on their IDs.
- Updating an existing task: Modifying the details of an existing task.
- Deleting a task: Removing a task from the list.

## Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:

- Creating a new task and verifying it's added to the list.
- Reading tasks and checking if the correct tasks are returned.
- Updating a task and ensuring the changes are reflected.
- Deleting a task and confirming it's removed from the list.
