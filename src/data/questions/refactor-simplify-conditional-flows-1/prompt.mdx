# Refactoring: Simplify Conditional Flows Using Objects - 1

> Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
> Because light attracts bugs!

## Objectives
- Identify areas in the 'calculateShippingCost' function that can be simplified.
- Refactor the function by using objects to represent conditional logic.
- Ensure that the code remains readable and maintainable.

## Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:
- The function returns the correct shipping cost for various weights and destinations.
- The function handles unexpected destinations by applying a default cost structure.
