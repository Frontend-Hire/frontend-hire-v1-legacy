# Responsive Card - 1

Cards are a popular design pattern in web development. They are used to group related information in a flexible and extensible manner. In this challenge, you will create a responsive card using HTML and CSS.

## Requirements

- Link for the Figma Design: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/nT3zhFaMpNLXeoRv2asrSp/Frontend-Hire?type=design&node-id=8-3&mode=design&t=aipoWxawFPKpEQuT-4">Responsive Card - 1</a>
- Your solution should match the design as closely as possible.
- Make sure you are using correct semantic HTML markup.

### Instructions

- Write your HTML markup in the **index.html** file.
- Write your CSS in the **styles.css** file.
- Your solution should use classic CSS. However, if you prefer, you can opt for TailwindCSS.

#### Enabling TailwindCSS (Optional)

If you choose to use TailwindCSS, include this script in the head of your **index.html** file:

```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

#### Notes

- The card should be responsive and should look good on all screen sizes.
- Login to Figma to inspect the design otherwise you will only see the design as an image.
- If you inspect the card properties in Figma, you will notice the use of min-width and max-width.
