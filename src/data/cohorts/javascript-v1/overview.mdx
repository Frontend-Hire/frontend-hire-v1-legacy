# JavaScript V1

<Callout>
This is a work-in-progress cohort! Expect drastic changes over time. The only reason we are releasing it is to gather feedback from you!
</Callout>

There is a lot to learn about JavaScript. But trying to learn everything is almost impossible. We can always search the web for unknown things. The fundamentals are important. That is what we will also focus on in this cohort.

Also, this is a very practical cohort with interactive exercises. We won't discuss historical theory or things that are trivia. Our goal is to know just enough programming to be able to use it to solve problems. 

Here's a quick overview of the cohort:

- How to run JavaScript?
- Comments
- Variables
