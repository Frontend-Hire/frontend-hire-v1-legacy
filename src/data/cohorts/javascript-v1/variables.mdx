# Variables

<Callout type='error'>
From now on, we will be talking a lot about JavaScript syntax. One thing that we won't discuss is semicolons. 

Even though semicolons are not mandatory in JavaScript. The convention agreed on by the majority of the JavaScript developers is to use them. 

**SO USE SEMICOLONS TO END A JAVASCRIPT STATEMENT**
</Callout>

How do you store something in your code that you want to use again later? Well in almost all programming languages, you do that with variables.

<Callout>
Interview Question: Where does the JavaScript Engine store the variables?

**Answer: The JavaScript engine stores the variables in a heap.**
</Callout>

In JavaScript, you can declare variables in three ways:

## 1. Using `let`

The `let` keyword is used to declare variables that can be reassigned.

Here are a few examples of using `let`:

```js
// Declare a variable without initializing it
let variableDeclared;

// Declare a variable as well as initialize it
let variableDeclaredAndInitialized = 21;

// Assign a value to a previously declared variable
variableDeclared = 'value assigned now';

/*
Variables can be reassigned to any data type
not a good idea but JavaScript won't complain
but your fellow developers will
*/ 
variableDeclaredAndInitialized = 'reassigned the value';
```

### Common Mistakes

**You cannot create another variable with the same name within the same scope.**

The below example will throw an error:

```js
let variableOne = 21;

// Attempt to redeclare a variable
let variableOne = 42; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'variableOne' has already been declared
```

But the below example will not throw an error:

```js
let variableOne = 21;
console.log(variableOne); // 21

{
  let variableOne = 42;
  console.log(variableOne); // 42
}

console.log(variableOne); // 21
```

**Even this won't throw an error but see how the output is different:**

```js
let variableOne = 21;
console.log(variableOne); // 21

{
  variableOne = 42;
  console.log(variableOne); // 42
}

console.log(variableOne); // 42
```

<Callout type="warning">
We will discuss more about the scope later in the cohort. But for now, just remember that `curly braces {}` creates a new scope and that there is a default global scope.

</Callout>

**Trying to access the same variable before it has been declared will throw an error:**

```js
let variableOne = 21;
console.log(variableOne); // 21
 
{
  console.log(variableOne); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variableOne' before initialization
  let variableOne = 42;
  console.log(variableOne); // Won't log due to ReferenceError
}
 
console.log(variableOne); // Won't log due to ReferenceError
```

But something like this will not throw an error:

```js
let variableOne = 21;
console.log(variableOne); // 21
 
{
  console.log(variableOne); // 21
  let variableTwo = 42;
  console.log(variableTwo); // 42
}
 
console.log(variableOne); // 21
```

**Trying to access a variable that is out of scope will throw an error:**

```js
let variableOne = 21;
console.log(variableOne); // 21
 
{
  console.log(variableOne); // 21
  let variableTwo = 42;
  console.log(variableTwo); // 42
}
 
console.log(variableOne); // 21
console.log(variableTwo); // Uncaught ReferenceError: variableTwo is not defined
```

## 2. Using `const`

The `const` keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

```js
// Basic constant declaration
const localConstant = 'can never take another value';

/*
Global constant declaration 
nothing different than basic constant declaration
except the naming convention tells developers that it is global
*/
const GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 'global constant';

const PI = 3.14;
```

### Common Mistakes

**Note: Variable rules are almost consistent. So, the above mistakes that apply to `let` also apply to `const`.**

**You can't reassign a constant.**

The below example will throw an error:

```js
const PI = 3.14;
// Attempt to reassign a constant
PI = 3.14159; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

{
  // This will also throw an error, REASSIGNING A CONSTANT IS A BIG NO!
  PI = 3.14159; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
}
```

## 3. Using `var`

<Callout type='error'>
This is optional to learn in our opinion and can be learned when you need it! We just do not recommend using `var` at all. Some might disagree with us. Learn it now if you want or feel free to skip this section and move on to [Variable Naming Rules](#variable-naming-rules).
