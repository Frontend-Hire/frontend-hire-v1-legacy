# How to run JavaScript?

JavaScript can run in any environment that can support the JavaScript engine. The most common environments are web browsers and Node.js.

In this cohort, we will initially work with web browsers. We will then move on to Node.js to do more advanced exercises.

**Note**: Though you can use any browser to run JavaScript we recommend using Chromium-based browsers to avoid confusion.

Here's how to run JavaScript in a web browser:
- Open a web browser (preferably Chrome or a Chromium-based browser).
- Right-click anywhere on a webpage and select **"Inspect"** or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac).
- In the Developer Tools that appear, click on the **"Console"** tab. If you don't see the Console tab, it might be hidden. Look for a **>>** or **+** icon to expand and reveal more tabs.
- Type your JavaScript code directly into the console and press Enter to execute it.
- To run multiple lines of code, use Shift+Enter to create new lines without executing.
- Press Enter after your last line to run the entire block of code.
- View the results immediately in the console output.

You can test by running the following code:

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
