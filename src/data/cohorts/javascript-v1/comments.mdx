# Comments

Comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable code in your programs.

In JavaScript, we can add two types of comments:

- Inline comments
- Multiline comments

```js showLineNumbers title="script.js"
// this is an inline comment

/* this is 
a multiline 
comment */
```

While in HTML, we can use `<!-- -->` to add comments for both inline and multiline.

```html showLineNumbers title="index.html"
<!-- this is an inline comment -->

<!-- this is 
a multiline 
comment -->
```

## Exercise

Here is a quick exercise to help you understand comments:

- Comment out the `h2` tag with the text "Comment Me Out!" in the `index.html` file.
- Comment out the `console.log` call with the text "Comment me out!" in the `index.html` file using an inline comment.
- Comment out the `console.log` call with the text "Long text that has to be commented out!" in the `script.js` file using a multiline comment.

<CommentsExercise />

<Callout>
Did you notice how `index.html` has two different comments? That is because within the `script` tag, it is all JavaScript while outside, it is all HTML.
</Callout>

<Callout>
There is also an editor shortcut to toggle comments: 
- On Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>
- On macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>

But it will only add inline comments if you try to comment multiple lines in this interactive editor. Some editors will allow multiline comments:
- On Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>
- On macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>
</Callout>

## When to use Comments?

While comments can help understand code, it is important to use them sparingly. Here are some guidelines:

- Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.

- Avoid commenting on trivial or self-explanatory code.

- Keep comments concise and up-to-date with the code.

<Callout type="warning">
There should usually not be complex logic that cannot be explained with code. But sometimes it makes the job much easier. For non-obvious decisions, comments are a lifesaver.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
There is something called [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) that a lot of folks use to document their libraries. The common issue with such types of comments is that they also have to be maintained along with the code. We will cover JSDoc later in the cohort.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
We have seen too many folks using comments to disable code. This just clutters the codebase. Just delete that code instead of commenting if you use version control like Git. Your version control already tracks the code so you can always find it. We will cover version control with Git later in the cohort.
</Callout>

As a beginner, feel free to add comments liberally to aid your learning. As you gain experience, you will develop a sense of when comments are truly necessary.

**Note:** We would also be using comments to nudge you into doing something or try to explain things better.
