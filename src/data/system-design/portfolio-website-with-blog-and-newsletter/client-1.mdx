# Client 1

Here are the requirements for Client 1:

- The client is a `developer` and wants to showcase their projects and skills.
- The client wants to have a `blog` to share their experiences and knowledge.
- The client wants to have a newsletter to keep the audience updated about the latest articles.
- The client wants to have a `custom domain`.
- The client wants to have a `fast` and `responsive` website.
- The client is tech-savvy and wants to have full control over the website.

## Let us design the system for Client 1:

### Website Design

This is nothing but a portfolio website. Based on the designer's skills, they can choose to showcase their projects in different ways. They can have a list of projects with a brief description, or they can have a detailed page for each project.

We won't be discussing the design part in this document. We will focus on the technical implementation. So, let us assume that the designer gave a design with four pages.

- **Home:** This would be the landing page with most of the information about the developer.
- **Blog:** This would be the blog page with a list of blog posts.
- **Blog Post:** This would be the detailed page for a blog post.

Where does the newsletter fit in? The newsletter would be a simple form at the bottom of the blog post page. The user can enter their email address and subscribe to the newsletter. We'll cover more about the newsletter soon.

This is how it would look if we visualize the website structure:

The second page is titled 'Blog' and contains a section for 'Blog Posts' as well as a 'Newsletter Subscription' option at the bottom. The third page is detailed as 'Blog/[post-slug]' and displays a single 'Blog Post' with another option for 'Newsletter Subscription' at the bottom. The layout is minimalistic, with each page represented as a rectangle with rounded corners and all text in white on a dark background.](./assets/client-1.webp)

### Blog Design

Since the client is a developer, they would prefer to write their blog posts in Markdown.
