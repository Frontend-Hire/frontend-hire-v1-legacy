# Design a Portfolio Website with a Blog and a Newsletter

> Pretty simple? Not really.

## Introduction

In this system design guide, we will cover various clients and their requirements and constraints for designing a portfolio website with a blog and a newsletter. We will also discuss the architecture, data flow, and the technologies that can be used to build this system.

Though we say `design`, we will not be designing the UI/UX of the website. We will be focusing on the system architecture and the technologies that can be used to develop the website.

- With a real client, you would need to worry about the UI/UX part of the website too.
- The UI/UX part is equally important as the system architecture.
- We won't be discussing the UI/UX part in this guide.
