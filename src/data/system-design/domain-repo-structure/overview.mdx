# Design the Domain Structure for a Web Application

## Problem

You have joined a company as a founding UI engineer. Your job is to design the domain structure for all the web applications the company is going to develop.

Here is a quick requirement from the company:

- A landing page with products, pricing, and blog. (let us call this company as just `company`)
- A product (a web app called `Store`) with three different types of users: customers, employees, and admins
- Another product (a web app called `Learn`) with two different types of users: learners and teachers

So, how would you set up the domains for the company with multiple user-facing web apps?
