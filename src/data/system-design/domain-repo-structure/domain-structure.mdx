# Domain Structure

Let us have a look at the requirements again:

- A landing page
- A product (a web app called FEH Store) with three different types of users: customers, employees, and admins
- Another product (a web app called FEH Learn) with two different types of users: learners and teachers

Before we try to structure the domains, let us understand what a domain is.

## What is a domain?

To access any website on the internet you have to know the IP Address of that website (Something like `142.250.71.46`, this is Google's IP Address) these IP Addresses are difficult to remember. So, to make it easier we instead use human-friendly names called domains (like `google.com`).

<Callout>
How to check the IP Address of a website? We can use the `nslookup` command. We use the domain name to get the IP Address in this case.

```bash
nslookup google.com

Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 142.250.71.46
```
</Callout>

### Parts of a Domain

Every domain has parts to it. 

For example, `google.com` has two parts: `google` and `com`. Here, `google` is called the **second-level domain (SLD)** and `com` is called the **top-level domain (TLD)**. In the case, of `google.co.in`, there are three parts: `google`, `co`, and `in`. `google` is called the **third-level domain**. `co` is the **SLD**. `in` is called the **TLD**. 

There is virtually no limit to how many lower levels a domain can have. But mostly the levels are around 2-4. Alright, why is this important? Well, we will use this to structure our domains soon.

## Landing Page Domain Structure

We know a bit about domains now. Let us try to use this knowledge to structure the domain structure for the landing page. This is going to be simple.

Most companies have their landing or marketing pages with a domain like `company.com` but they also redirect the sub
