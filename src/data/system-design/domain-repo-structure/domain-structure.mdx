# Domain Structure

Let us have a look at the requirements again:

- A marketing site with a products page, pricing page, and blog page. (let us call this company as just `company`)
- A product (a web app called `Store`) with three different types of users: customers, employees, and admins
- Another product (a web app called `Learn`) with two different types of users: learners and teachers

Before we try to structure the domains, let us understand what a domain is.

## What is a domain?

To access any website on the internet you have to know the IP Address of that website (Something like `142.250.71.46`, this is Google's IP Address) these IP Addresses are difficult to remember. So, to make it easier we instead use human-friendly names called domains (like `google.com`).

<Callout>
How to check the IP Address of a website? We can use the `nslookup` command. We use the domain name to get the IP Address in this case.

```bash
nslookup google.com

Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 142.250.71.46
```
</Callout>

### Parts of a Domain

Every domain has parts to it. 

For example, `google.com` has two parts: `google` and `com`. Here, `google` is called the **second-level domain (SLD)** and `com` is called the **top-level domain (TLD)**. In the case, of `google.co.in`, there are three parts: `google`, `co`, and `in`. `google` is called the **third-level domain**. `co` is the **SLD**. `in` is called the **TLD**. 

There is virtually no limit to how many lower levels a domain can have. But mostly the levels are around 2-4. Alright, why is this important? Well, we will use this to structure our domains soon.

<Callout>
We call URLs that use directories after the main domain (like company.com/blog) **"subdirectories"** while URLs that add a prefix before the main domain (like blog.company.com) are called **"subdomains"**.
</Callout>

## Marketing Site Domain Structure

We know a bit about domains now. Let us try to use this knowledge to structure the domain structure for the marketing site. This is going to be simple.

Most companies have their landing or marketing pages with a domain like `www.company.com` but they also sometimes have it on the naked domain like `company.com` and redirect `www.company.com` to it.

In our case, we also have three more pages: `products`, `pricing`, and `blog`.

We can structure these as subdirectories, something like this:

- **www.company.com**
- **www.company.com/products**
- **www.company.com/pricing**
- **www.company.com/blog**

But depending on the requirements, we can create a subdomain for the blog instead like `blog.company.com`.

Things that favor a subdomain for the blog are the following:

- The blog has grown significantly and requires its own technical infrastructure.
- The blog has a distinct brand identity or target audience.
- There's a need for more flexibility in managing the blog separately from the main site.
- The company plans to expand the blog into a more substantial content platform.

<Callout>
Having a subdomain for a blog can potentially dilute the SEO value of the main marketing site.

### Real World Examples

- Try to search for [whatsapp.com](https://whatsapp.com/) and see what happens.

- We get redirected to `https://www.whatsapp.com/`.

- Now, search for [openai.com](https://openai.com/) and see what happens.

- We are **not redirected** and are on the same domain `https://openai.com/`.

What about their `blog` page? 

- WhatsApp has the blog located at a subdomain [blog.whatsapp.com](https://blog.whatsapp.com/).

- Whereas OpenAI has its news page (just like a blog) on the main domain [openai.com/news](https://openai.com/news/).

## Store Product Domain Structure

This is where we have to think a lot. But at the top of our minds, we can think of one major question.

> Does this product have an independent domain?

**If No**

This is a quite common scenario. In this case, we can use the main company domain and create a subdomain like `store.company.com`.

However, an alternative approach is to use the main domain with subdirectories, like company.com/store. While this can work, it's important to consider potential URL clashes:

- **Existing content:** If company.com already has a rich structure of pages and content, adding `/store` and its subsequent pages might conflict with existing or future content plans.

- **Naming conflicts:** There's a risk of path naming conflicts. For example: `company.com/products` might be intended to showcase the company's main products or services. `company.com/store/products` would be needed for the store's product listings. This can lead to confusion for both users and content managers.

- **Depth of URL structure:** Using the main domain might result in deeper URL structures, like `company.com/store/category/subcategory/product-name`. This can make URLs longer and potentially less user-friendly.

- **Future expansion:** As the store grows, it might require more complex URL structures, which could increasingly conflict with the main site's content.

- **Shared resources:** Using the main domain might cause conflicts in shared resources like robots.txt, sitemaps, and certain types of cookies or local storage.

- **Analytics and tracking:** It may be more challenging to separate analytics data for the store from the main site when they share the same domain.

To mitigate these issues, using a subdomain like `store.company.com` can provide a cleaner separation and reduce the risk of URL clashes. It allows for:

- Independent URL structures
- Clearer division of content
- Easier management of store-specific resources
- More straightforward analytics separation

But there is still a problem: what about the different types of users?

We have three types of users: customers, employees, and admins. So, we could again structure it like this:

- **For customers:** `store.company.com` or maybe `store.company.com/customers` or `customers.store.company.com`
- **For employees:** `store.company.com/employees` or `employees.store.company.com`
- **For admins:** `store.company.com/admins` or `admins.store.company.com`

The way you structure depends on how complex each of the user's operations are.

**Yes, at `store.com`**

If the store has its independent domain, we have more flexibility in structuring the URLs. Here's a possible setup:

- Maybe another marketing site at `www.store.com` or `store.com`
- **For customers:** `customers.store.com` or `store.com/customers`
- **For employees:** `employees.store.com` or `store.com/employees`
- **For admins:** `admin.store.com` or `store.com/admins`

### Real World Examples

WhatsApp is again a good example here. They have two types of users: web (regular users) and business (business users).

Their `web` product is at [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) and their `business` product is at [business.whatsapp.com](https://business.whatsapp.com/).

## Learn Product Domain Structure

This is similar to the store domain structure. We can use the same approach.

As with the store product, we need to consider the primary question:

> Does this learning product have an independent domain?

**If No**

In this scenario, we can utilize the main company domain and create a subdomain like `learn.company.com`.

Alternatively, we could use the main domain with subdirectories, such as company.com/learn. However, this approach comes with similar considerations and potential issues as discussed in the store product section:

- Potential conflicts with existing content
- Naming conflicts
- Deep URL structures
- Future expansion limitations
- Shared resource management
- Analytics and tracking challenges

Using a subdomain like `learn.company.com` can provide a cleaner separation and reduce these risks.

For different user types, we could structure it as follows:

- **For learners:** `learn.company.com` or maybe `learn.company.com/students` or `students.learn.company.com`
- **For teachers:** `learn.company.com/instructors` or `instructors.learn.company.com`

The specific structure would depend on the complexity of each user type's operations and the desired level of separation.

**Yes, at learn.com**
If the learning product has its own independent domain, we have more flexibility in structuring the URLs. Here's a possible setup:

- Main site or marketing page: `www.learn.com` or `learn.com`
- **For students:** `students.learn.com` or `learn.com/students`
- **For instructors:** `instructors.learn.com` or `learn.com/instructors`
- **For admins:** `admin.learn.com` or `learn.com/admins`

### Real World Examples

Udemy is a great example here that mixes different types of users.

- **Main site:** `www.udemy.com`
- **For learners:** `www.udemy.com`
- **For instructors:** `www.udemy.com/teaching`
- **For organizations:** `business.udemy.com`

## Conclusion

Great, we saw how to structure the domains. Let us also see how to structure the repositories of these projects in the next section.
