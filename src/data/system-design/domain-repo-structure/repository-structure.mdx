# Repository Structure

This is going to be tricky. A lot of factors will come into play. We will try to cover as much as possible.

Another look at the requirements:

- A marketing site with a products page, pricing page, and blog page. (let us call this company as just `company`)
- A product (a web app called `Store`) with three different types of users: customers, employees, and admins
- Another product (a web app called `Learn`) with two different types of users: learners and teachers
