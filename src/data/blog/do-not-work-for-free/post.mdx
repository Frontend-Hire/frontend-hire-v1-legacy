Surprisingly, I get many requests from people wanting to work for free due to my work on Frontend Hire.

I will never let anyone work for free. But even if I had the budget to pay them something I would rarely onboard them and the reason is simple: 

"Cost does not just come from monetary things. There is also a hidden cost of my time used to manage and teach you."

I would only onboard people when I have much work I want to delegate away. This work is usually not on Frontend Hire but for my dev studio clients.

Also, a top advice for people wanting to work for free. 

"Do not work for free! Instead, pay up for some mentorship!"

People fail to realize the power of mentorship. I never had a mentor who could teach me web development. I thought I could learn it all on my own. I did learn it but at a huge expense of time.

It took me two years to be good at web development. Maybe with a mentor, it would have taken less than a year. There is a reason why some folks charge a lot for mentorship, the ROI is just exponential.

So, before you think something is expensive compare it with the time factor and make a decision.

"Money can always be earned back, time is a different story."
