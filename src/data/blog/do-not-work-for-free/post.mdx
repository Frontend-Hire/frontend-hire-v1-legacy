## The Problem

> Surprisingly, I get many requests from people wanting to work for free due to my work on Frontend Hire.

Usually, this would have not been the case where people would be desperate to work for free in software development at least. But the job market has been down for a while now. Fresh graduates and folks with less than 2 years of experience are competing with more experienced folks. As far as internships are concerned the market is pretty much dead.

This is leading to many willing to work for free for the sake of experience. But as I wrote in the original post. Most of such free work will not result in any great experience. You would just end up being free labor working on useless or unproductive stuff. 

Now, even if someone offers to pay a little for also the sake of it. You would still not learn much as now the person who onboards you has to spend their own time and energy to teach and mentor you.

So, what should you do instead of working for free?

## The Solution

Pay for some mentorship!

This might sound weird but why pay someone when there are also a ton of free resources out there that you use to learn instead of paying someone to mentor you, right?

But the amount of free resources out there will just result in an information overload. You would just keep looking for resources, switching here and there with no real progress or delaying the progress by a lot.

This is where a mentor can help you and of course, most won't do it for free. The ones who did it for free are usually YouTubers with generic advice to help at scale. 

But you most probably need someone to personally help you with this stuff. Mentorship can really help you go 2x or even 5x on your learning and upskill you way faster than that stupid work you wanted to do for free.

Now you might complain that you have already paid a lot for academic education and again now you have to pay some random person for further education. 

Well, the mentor is someone who already works in your desired role, probably making good money. They already know the struggle to get there and they can cut that struggle down for you.

Of course, you can reach those positions without a mentor but at a huge expense of time. This is where you have to calculate the cost of mentorship and the cost of your time. If I could go back in time, I would have most probably paid someone to get me up to speed.

> **Also do remember! Mentor doesn't teach you everyday, they are someone who will nudge you in the right direction when you feel lost while maybe sometimes teach you things directly.**

If you can afford mentorship, go for it.

If you cannot afford mentorship, try to get those bulk mentorships for free.

**But never agree to work for free! Nothing below the minimum wage ever!**
