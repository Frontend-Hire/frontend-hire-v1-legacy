## Frontend Hire Tips

- Do **not** jump directly into React without learning foundational JavaScript!
- React at **its core is simple**, and most of the complexity comes from the ecosystem of React.
- If your **foundations are strong**, you can easily be comfortable in the React ecosystem.
- Learn the different **component design patterns** as quickly as possible.
- Have **[this roadmap from roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/react)** in your bookmarks and refer to it often.


### Our Top List Of Courses To Do

Choose only one, and immediately switch if the chosen one does not suit your learning style (**money can be earned back but time?**)

<ol className="not-prose flex flex-col gap-4">

      <GuideSpecialItem {...item} />
    </li>
  ))}
</ol>
