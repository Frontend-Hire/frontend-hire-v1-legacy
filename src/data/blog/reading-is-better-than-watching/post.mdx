I learned most of React by watching a lot of videos back in 2021. To be precise, I watched Udemy courses and YouTube tutorials. Did I fail to learn React? No, I did not. `But I did fail to learn it effectively`.

## 1 hour of video = 10 minutes of text

> 1 hour of reading = 6 hours of content + 5 hours of more time.

Two months ago I launched [a free course](https://www.frontendhire.com/courses/todo-app-react/overview) that took me maybe **an hour** to write. I also thought it would be nice to repurpose this course into a video. So, I sat down to make a video version. Surprisingly, I ended up making [6 videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGQzf3dS9UqM7dLaYF6OMyGGqPG9lWDXy&feature=shared) with a total runtime of **91 minutes**.

Did I cover more content in the video? Yes. But if someone read the course, they would have covered most of the content in **less than 30 minutes**. The rest of the little details can easily be covered later and better with more reading material.

Most of us already watch videos at a playback speed greater than **one**. I do not mean to say you cannot learn by watching. But you could learn more by reading. This greatly applies to software developers. Why? Because we have to read a lot of code at our work. No one converts it to video for us.

The workflow at Frontend Hire is simple, to make text content first, then based on the feedback from the text content, make video content.

## Skipping text is easier than skipping video

> Do not feel afraid to skip stuff. What you know is better than what you don't know.

A lot of people underestimate the productivity gains of skipping stuff. Let us assume you are doing a course with 10 chapters and let us also say that you know 3 chapters pretty well and want to skip. Or let us assume that some of the stuff is just difficult to understand and you want to skip it.

If you watch a video, skipping means a lot of cognitive disturbance (you skip a bit and then wait to check if the content is still the same) but with text, this skipping is seamless. 

Another reason why I break down the course content into various chapters with repo checkpoints. So, that you can always start a new chapter without any constraint here on Frontend Hire.

## Not all good content is available in video format

> Video content can only be made if there is a text inspiration to make it.

How do people make video content in the first place? A lot of folks who make this video content read a lot! They go through the documentation, blog posts, Discord, GitHub, and even books. 

The first React video tutorial can only come from the team that built it, or from the person who read the docs.

## Conclusion

I am not saying don't watch videos. I too watch a lot of videos but if there is the same content in the text, I would not waste a second watching the video. 

Do you know what is even better than reading? Practicing! For example, I learned Svelte only by going through the official documentation and their interactive tutorials.

**Frontend Hire won't just be about content. It will be about optimized content for maximized learning. More on this in the future.**
