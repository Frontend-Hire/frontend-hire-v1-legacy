# Feature: Video Player

You see a lot of clones of Netflix on the internet but not the video player. Imagine you join a video streaming service company and you are rarely responsible for building the whole project rather you would be assigned to build a component of the project. An example being assigned to build or improve the video player component. Just have a look at the sophistication of Netflix's or any prominent video streaming service's video player and try building one of similar quality.
