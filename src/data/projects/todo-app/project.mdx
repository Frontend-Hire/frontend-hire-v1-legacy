# Todo App

While many developers create Todo apps, only a few stand out enough to be noteworthy on a resume. Beyond basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, exceptional Todo apps offer advanced functionalities, significantly enhancing the user experience.

<ProjectTasks>
  <ProjectTaskItem id={1} taskName='Setup React Project'>
    Use any of your preferred way to setup a new React project.
    - Note: We suggest Vite and Vitest for this project but feel free to use alternatives if you do not prefer Vite.
    - Our projects lists these setup guides as projects themselves!
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={2} taskName='Vitest & React Testing Library'>
    This project recommends using a testing library to build with confidence.
    - We suggest using Vitest as the testing framework: <a href="https://vitest.dev/" target='_blank'>Vitest</a>.
    - React Testing Library is a popular library for testing React apps:<a href='https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro' target='_blank'>React Testing Library (RTL)</a>.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={3} taskName='Custom Hook for Tasks'>
    Develop a custom React hook to manage tasks. This hook should encapsulate all task-related logic including fetching, adding, updating, and deleting tasks. 
    - Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects.
    - Consider creating custom functions within the hook for operations like addTask, deleteTask, updateTask, etc.
    - This hook will centralize the task logic, making it reusable across different components while tesing also being lot easier now!
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={4} taskName='Feature: Tokens'>
    Develop a token-based system for parsing and interpreting user input when adding new tasks. This feature aims to enhance user experience by allowing natural language inputs and automatically extracting key information such as dates, priorities, and tags.
    - Implement a function to parse the user's input and identify key tokens (e.g., dates, priorities).
    - Utilize regular expressions or string matching techniques to identify patterns in the input.
    - After parsing, convert the identified tokens into structured data that can be used by the task management system.
    - Integrate this feature into the task creation process, ensuring that users can input tasks using natural language, and the system will automatically categorize and organize these tasks based on the extracted tokens.
    - Provide examples and documentation on how users can effectively use this feature.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={5} taskName='Feature: Read'>
    Implement the 'Read' feature to display tasks. Focus on fetching and rendering tasks from a mock API or local state. Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
    - Consider pagination or infinite scroll for handling large numbers of tasks.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={6} taskName='Feature: Create'>
    Develop the ability to add new tasks. This should include a user-friendly form with validations. Highlight the use of controlled components in React for form handling.
    - Explore dynamic form fields for additional task details.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={7} taskName='Feature: Update'>
    Create functionality to update existing tasks. This should allow editing task details inline or through a dedicated edit view.
    - Emphasize state management and the seamless update of the UI.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={8} taskName='Feature: Delete'>
    Implement task deletion, ensuring a smooth user experience. Include confirmations to prevent accidental deletions.
    - Discuss the importance of updating the application state post-deletion.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={9} taskName='Feature: Complete'>
    Add a feature to mark tasks as completed. This could include striking through completed tasks and filtering them out or moving them to a 'completed' section.
    - Focus on UI feedback and state transitions for a better user experience.
  </ProjectTaskItem>
