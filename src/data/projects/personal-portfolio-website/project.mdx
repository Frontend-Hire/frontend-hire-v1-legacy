# Personal Portfolio Website

Having a personal portfolio website is a fantastic way to showcase your skills and projects to potential employers or clients. 

In fact, as a frontend developer, it is almost expected that you have a portfolio site. This project will guide you through creating a personal portfolio website.

Here is an example of a portfolio site: <a href='https://www.iamyhr.com/' target='_blank'>Hruthik Reddy Yarala</a>.

<ProjectTasks>
  <ProjectTaskItem id={1} taskName='Find Inspiration'>
    Before you start designing, look for inspiration online.
    - Visit websites like Behance, Dribbble, and Awwwards for design ideas.
    - Pay attention to the latest web design trends.
    - Note down elements you find appealing and think about how you can incorporate them into your design while keeping your unique style.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={2} taskName='Design in Figma'>
    Most folks do not use Figma at all and start writing the code directly. This is not neccessarily a bad thing, but it is not the best approach. Having a design in place helps you visualize the final product and saves you time in the long run. Also, it is far easier to update a design than to update the code.

    - Begin by designing your portfolio in Figma. If you're new to Figma, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the tool.
    - Focus on creating a clean and intuitive user interface.
    - Your design should include a home page, about section, portfolio section, and contact information.
    - Consider responsiveness in your design to ensure your site looks great on all devices.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={3} taskName='Setup Next.js Project'>
    Set up a new Next.js project for your portfolio.
    - Next.js offers benefits in terms of SEO and performance, making it an ideal choice for your portfolio.
    - Follow the official Next.js documentation for setup: <a href='https://nextjs.org/docs' target='_blank'>Next.js Documentation</a>.
    - Structure your project to mirror the design you created in Figma.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={4} taskName='Deployment'>
    Once your portfolio is ready, deploy it using Vercel or any other hosting service.
    - Vercel offers a seamless deployment process for Next.js applications.
    - Follow the guidelines provided by your hosting service to deploy your site.
    - Test your deployed site to ensure everything works as expected.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={5} taskName='Acquire a Custom Domain'>
    Consider purchasing a custom domain, preferably with your name, to add a professional touch to your portfolio.
    - Use domain registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Squarespace to find and purchase a domain.
    - Choose a domain name that is easy to remember and reflects your personal brand.
    - If your name is not available, consider adding a middle initial or a hyphen.
    - Do note that you will have to pay a yearly fee to keep your domain.
  </ProjectTaskItem>

  <ProjectTaskItem id={6} taskName='Connect Domain to Hosting Provider'>
    Connect your custom domain to your hosting provider.
    - Follow the instructions provided by your hosting service to link your domain.
    - Ensure that your domain settings are correctly configured for smooth navigation.
    - Test the domain to ensure it directs to your portfolio site properly.
