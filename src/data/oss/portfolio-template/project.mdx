## Purpose of this Project

<Callout>
Hruthik has written a blog on the same subject, ["The story behind this website!"](https://www.iamyhr.com/blog/the-story-behind-this-website/)
</Callout>

For this particular project `Portfolio Template`, the purpose is straightforward:

- Most developers lack a quality personal website.
- We want to give them a good template and a philosophy to build or learn in public.
- As a contributor to this project, you help add value to the project by adding new features and bug fixes.
