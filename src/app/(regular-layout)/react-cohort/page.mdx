# 2-Day React Cohort

Dates: **1st and 2nd of June 2024**.

Time: **11:00 AM to 12:30 pm** and **2:00 PM to 3:30 PM** on both days.

Timezone: **Indian Standard Time (IST)**.

The core React library is pretty small and should not take long to learn. However, the ecosystem around React is vast and can be overwhelming. This 2-day cohort is designed to help you get up to speed with core React and some of its ecosystems.

This is our **first-ever cohort** and would be **entirely free**. But there are only **20 spots available**. 

## Requirements

- No prior knowledge of React is required
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A computer with a stable internet connection
- A quiet place to attend the live sessions

### Note:

- This cohort is not for experienced React developers. It is designed for beginners who want to learn React from basics. 
- The sessions will be live and not recorded. So, make sure you can attend the live sessions on the specified dates and times.

## Schedule

This is a 2-day cohort. Each day will have **two sessions**. The first session will be from **11:00 AM to 12:30 PM** and the second session will be from **2:00 PM to 3:30 PM**. All times are in **Indian Standard Time (IST)**.
