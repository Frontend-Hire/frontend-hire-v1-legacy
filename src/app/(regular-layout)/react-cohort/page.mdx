# 7-Day React Cohort

The core React library is pretty small and should not take long to learn. However, the ecosystem around React is vast and can be overwhelming. This 7-day cohort is designed to help you get up to speed with React and its ecosystem.

This is our **first-ever cohort** and would be **entirely free**. But there are only **14 spots available**. The exact dates are not yet decided. But the time will be **7:30 PM IST**. If you are interested, please fill out the form below. We will get back to you with more details.

## Requirements

- No prior knowledge of React is required
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A computer with a stable internet connection
- A quiet place to attend the live sessions

## Schedule

This is a 7-day cohort. **Each day, for 90 minutes in a live session with the founder**, you will learn something new about React and its ecosystem. The sessions will be interactive and you can ask questions.
