## Introduction

Companies hire for various reasons. It could be to fill a vacant position, to expand the team, or to replace an employee who has left. Either way, you as an interviewer might already be pretty tight on time. But that should not be an excuse to not prepare for the interview. If you are not prepared, you might end up hiring the wrong person, which could be a costly mistake for the company. Or you might end up losing a good candidate to another company.

In this guide, I will help you prepare for the interview and try to get the best out of the candidate. This guide is broken down into three parts: before, during, and after the interview.

**I assume that you are already familiar with the company's hiring process and the role you are hiring for.**

## Before the interview

### Prepare the questions based on the resume

This might sound obvious, but it is important to read the candidate's resume before the interview. This is because <SpecialText>their resume is what they have mostly worked on and are comfortable talking about.</SpecialText> You can ask them questions about their projects, the technologies they have worked on, and the challenges they have faced.

Also, prepare questions on what they would also be working on if they joined the company. This can greatly cut the cost of training and onboarding.

Do avoid Leetcode-style questions or hard DSA problems unless the role requires it. If your company does have a policy of asking such questions, make sure to be as relevant as possible to the actual work they would be doing.

### Make sure to check the network connection

Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. If you are using a laptop, make sure that it is fully charged or plugged in. 

I would also suggest having a backup plan in case the internet goes down. You can use <SpecialText>your phone as a hotspot that would use WiFi and switch to mobile data in case of any issues</SpecialText>.

Also, let the candidate know about the backup plan in advance, so it doesn't cause unnecessary panic to them.

### Have a notebook and a pen

It is always a good idea to have a notebook and a pen with you. This helps you <SpecialText>follow up on the candidate's answers</SpecialText> and take notes. It also helps you to jot down any questions that come to your mind during the interview.

Also, helps to give feedback to the candidate if time allows at the end of the interview.

### Check the camera

You should be turning on your camera during the interview. If for some reason you can't, let the candidate know in advance. Talking to a blank screen can be very uncomfortable for the candidate.

Make sure that your camera is working properly. Use the platform you will be using for the interview to check if the camera is working. Give any browser permissions that are required for the camera to work. 

MacOS users, make sure to permit the system security to use the camera well before the interview as it will ask you to restart the application.

If you use an external screen and your laptop is to the side, disconnect the external screen and just use your laptop for the interview. If you greatly desire an external screen, also invest in an external webcam.

<SpecialText>All that matters is that you are facing towards the camera!</SpecialText>

### Check the microphone

These things are troublesome. Make sure that your microphone is working properly. Use the platform you will be using for the interview to check if the microphone is working. Make sure the audio level is good and there is no background noise. 

MacOS users, make sure to give the permissions to the system security to use the microphone well before the interview as it will ask you to restart the application.

Make sure any external headphones you use are configured properly and there are no input device issues.

## During the interview

### Allow the use of the Internet and an IDE

If the role requires the candidate to code, you should allow them to use the internet and an IDE. This is because <SpecialText>in real life, they will be using the internet and an IDE to write code.</SpecialText>

<SpecialText>Also, allow them to use AI if the company uses it.</SpecialText> This will help you to see how they use the tools to solve problems. Of course, do let them know that they should not be using the internet to look up the answers to the questions you ask them but rather to look up the documentation or to search for the best way to solve a problem.

### Ask your prepared questions

Start the interview by asking the questions you have prepared. This will help you to get a good understanding of the candidate's skills and experience. So, you can <SpecialText>optimize the rest of the interview based on their answers.</SpecialText>

### Aim for a conversation rather than an interrogation

The interview should be a two-way conversation. You should be asking questions and the candidate should be answering them. But it should not feel like an interrogation. <SpecialText>Pitch in your thoughts and experiences as well.</SpecialText> This will help the candidate to feel comfortable and open up.

### Be mindful of the time

Sometimes, candidates might take a long time to answer a question. This is not necessarily a bad thing. They might be thinking about the best way to answer the question. But if you feel that the candidate is taking too long, you can gently nudge them to move on to the next question. <SpecialText>Judging them on a single question because you couldn't ask more questions is not fair.</SpecialText>

### Make it a pair programming session

<SpecialText>If the role requires the candidate to code, you should make it a pair programming session.</SpecialText> If the candidate does join the company, they will be working with a team. So, it is important to see how they work with others.

You can ask them to share their screen and write code. You can also write code on your screen and ask them to guide you. This will help you to see how they think and how they communicate. Maybe you can write the tests and ask them to write the code or vice versa.

### Do allow the candidate to ask questions at the end

At the end of the interview, you should allow the candidate to ask questions. This will help you to see how interested they are in the role and the company. It will also help you to see if they have done their research on the company.

### If time allows, give feedback

If time allows, you should give feedback to the candidate. This will help them to understand where they stand and what they need to work on. This will also help them to improve for future interviews. <SpecialText>Your direct feedback helps better than you passing on the feedback to the recruiter.</SpecialText>

## After the interview

### Pass on the feedback to the recruiter immediately 

<SpecialText>Time will decay the memory of the interview.</SpecialText> So, it is important to pass on the feedback to the recruiter immediately. Try to avoid giving quantitative feedback like "I rate the candidate 7/10". Instead, give qualitative feedback like "The candidate was good at problem-solving but needs to work on their communication skills".

<SpecialText>Also, do not be biased in any way.</SpecialText> Do not let any sad stories from the candidate's life affect your decision. You should only be judging them based on their skills and experience. Bias will only lead to a bad hire.
