## Before the interview

### Research the company

Honestly, unless it is your dream company, you don't need to know everything about the company. But it is good to know the basics like what the company does, its mission, and its culture. 

By researching the company, you will be ready to answer questions like <SpecialText>"Why do you want to work here?"</SpecialText> or <SpecialText>"What do you know about our company?"</SpecialText>.

### Research the people

If you know who will be interviewing you, it is a good idea to look them up on LinkedIn. This will help you to understand their background and what they might be looking for in a candidate.

Their <SpecialText>most used technologies, their previous work, and their interests</SpecialText> can give you a good idea of what to expect from the interview.

### Ask questions to your recruiter about the interview

Do not hesitate to ask your recruiter about the interview process. You can ask about the format of the interview, the number of interviewers, and the topics that will be covered.

### Make sure to check the network connection

Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. If you are using a laptop, make sure that it is fully charged or plugged in. 

I would also suggest having a backup plan in case the internet goes down. You can use <SpecialText>your phone as a hotspot that would use WiFi and switch to mobile data in case of any issues</SpecialText>.

Also, let your interviewer know about the backup plan in advance.

### Have a notebook and a pen

It is always a good idea to have a notebook and a pen with you. You can use it to write down the questions you want to ask, the things you want to remember, and the feedback you get from the interviewer.

Also, helps solve those <SpecialText>logical problems on paper first</SpecialText>.
