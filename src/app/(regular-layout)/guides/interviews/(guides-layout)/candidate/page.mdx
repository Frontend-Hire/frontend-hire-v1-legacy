## Before the interview

### Research the company

Honestly, unless it is your dream company, you don't need to know everything about the company. But it is good to know the basics like what the company does, its mission, and its culture. 

By researching the company, you will be ready to answer questions like <SpecialText>"Why do you want to work here?"</SpecialText> or <SpecialText>"What do you know about our company?"</SpecialText>.

### Research the people

If you know who will be interviewing you, it is a good idea to look them up on LinkedIn. This will help you to understand their background and what they might be looking for in a candidate.

Their <SpecialText>most used technologies, their previous work, and their interests</SpecialText> can give you a good idea of what to expect from the interview.

### Ask questions to your recruiter about the interview

Do not hesitate to ask your recruiter about the interview process. You can ask about the format of the interview, the number of interviewers, and the topics that will be covered.

### Make sure to check the network connection

Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. If you are using a laptop, make sure that it is fully charged or plugged in. 

I would also suggest having a backup plan in case the internet goes down. You can use <SpecialText>your phone as a hotspot that would use WiFi and switch to mobile data in case of any issues</SpecialText>.

Also, let your interviewer know about the backup plan in advance.

### Have a notebook and a pen

It is always a good idea to have a notebook and a pen with you. You can use it to write down the questions you want to ask, the things you want to remember, and the feedback you get from the interviewer.

Also, helps solve those <SpecialText>logical problems on paper first</SpecialText>.

### Check the camera

Make sure that your camera is working properly. Use the platform you will be using for the interview to check if the camera is working. Give any browser permissions that are required for the camera to work. 

MacOS users, make sure to give the permissions to the system security to use the camera well before the interview as it will ask you to restart the application.

If you use an external screen and your laptop is to the side, disconnect the external screen and just use your laptop for the interview. If you greatly desire an external screen, also invest in an external webcam.

<SpecialText>All that matters is that you are facing towards the camera!</SpecialText>

### Check the microphone

These things are troublesome. Make sure that your microphone is working properly. Use the platform you will be using for the interview to check if the microphone is working. Make sure the audio level is good and there is no background noise. 

MacOS users, make sure to give the permissions to the system security to use the microphone well before the interview as it will ask you to restart the application.

Make sure any external headphones you use are configured properly and their is no input device issues.

### Practice the general introduction

You will be asked to introduce yourself. Make sure you have a general introduction prepared. 

You can omit the name part as the interviewer already knows your name.

Do not try to memorize the introduction. Just have a general idea of what you want to say. <SpecialText>Keep it natural</SpecialText> and don't sound like you are reading from a script.

### Be on time, or early

Make sure you are on time for the interview. If you are using a platform like Zoom, make sure you have the link to the meeting and you know how to join the meeting. Do not wait until the last minute to join the meeting. 

Sometimes, you will have to go through a registration process before joining the meeting.

<SpecialText>Join the meeting 5 minutes before the scheduled time.</SpecialText> This will give you some time to relax and prepare yourself for the interview. Also, might give you extra time with the interviewer if they arrive early too.

## During the interview

### Listen carefully

Listen carefully to the questions asked by the interviewer. Make sure you understand the question before you start answering. If you are not sure about the question, ask the interviewer to repeat the question.

<SpecialText>Make notes</SpecialText> of the question if you are solving a problem. This will help you to keep track of the problem and the solution.

Also, do not interrupt the interviewer while they are asking the question. Let them finish the question and then start asking further questions if you have any.

### Take your time to answer

Do not rush to answer the question. Take your time to think about the question. Ask more questions if you are not sure about the answer. 

Interviewer will be happy to help you understand the question better. If you really don't know the answer, it is okay to say that you don't know the answer and ask for a hint or try to give an assumption how it could be solved.

### Talk through the solution while solving

If you are solving a problem, make sure you talk through the solution while solving the problem. This will help the interviewer to understand your thought process. In fact, any fellow developer would love to hear your thought process.

<SpecialText>Pair programming is a great way to solve problems.</SpecialText> This is the same thing. You are just explaining your thought process to the interviewer. Interviewer would also happily participate in the discussion.

### Ask questions

Do not hesitate to ask questions. Good questions can show your interest in the company and the role.

Here is a list of questions that you can refer to: [Reverse Interview Questions](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview).


### Ask for feedback if time allows

If you think you did not do well in the interview and you have some time left, ask the interviewer for feedback. This will help you to understand what you did wrong and what you can improve.

You could get the feedback later from the recruiter, but it is <SpecialText>always good to get the feedback from the interviewer directly.</SpecialText>

## After the interview

### Check your answers

Check all your answers you gave in the interview. Doing this immediately after the interview strengthens your memory and you can remember the questions and your answers better.

<SpecialText>Create Flash Cards if you get somethings wrong again and again.</SpecialText>

### Reject the offer if you are not interested

If you are not interested in the role, reject the offer as soon as possible. This will help the company to move forward with other candidates.

Also, <SpecialText>let the recruiter know of any alternative candidates you think would be a good fit for the role.</SpecialText>

### Send a thank you email to your recruiter

Send a thank you email to your recruiter for helping you with the interview process. This will help you to maintain a good relationship with the recruiter. 

<SpecialText>Recruiters are the some of the people who will help you in the future with other opportunities.</SpecialText> They would prefer you over other new candidates since you have previously cleared the interview process..
