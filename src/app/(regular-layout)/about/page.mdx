## Why we started Frontend Hire

Our founder observed huge gaps in the skill set of frontend developers and the expectations of the companies hiring them.

- Sometimes, folks with less experience on paper were better at the job than those with more experience.
- A lot of experienced folks have stagnated in their learning due to their work being repetitive and not challenging.
- Companies, though, always want to hire folks with more experience on paper.

These are problems and we want to solve them.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to help frontend developers grow in their careers and help companies hire good talent. We plan to do this by:

- We provide frontend questions with a coding workspace that helps you prepare for interviews and learn for the real world.
- We provide project guides to help you build resume-worthy real-world projects.
- We provide a set of interview-focused tools and services to help you prepare for interviews.
- We provide learning guides to help you learn the required skills and interview specific topics.
- We provide highly specific courses to help you learn excellent skills in a short period.
- We are already working on hiring tools to help companies employ good talent (some tools should be out by early 2025).

## Our Team

We are a small team, our founder, and a few excellent folks from the community providing discounted services through us. We are working hard to make this happen. We are always looking for feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to reach out to us at <CopyEmailOnClick email="info@frontendhire.com" />.
