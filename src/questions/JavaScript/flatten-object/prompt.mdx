# Flatten an Object

This is a question that I personally ask to any developer with at least one year of experience.

> Use case? Pretty common to have an object with nested structure and you want to flatten it! Sample inputs might give you better idea of the use case. 

#### What to do?
Give an object, print out the keys and values in-order. 
Do handle the edge cases:
- Empty Object can return empty strings.
- Think of other edge cases!

```
Input - 1: 
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": "49"
}
```
```
Output - 1:
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
age: 49
```
```
Input - 2: 
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John"
    "lastName": "Doe",
  }
  "age": "49"
}
```
```
Output - 2:
id: 123
name:
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
age: 49
```
